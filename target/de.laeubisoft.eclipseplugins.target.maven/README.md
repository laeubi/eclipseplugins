# Maven Eclipse Target Plugin
This plugin adds the ability to add maven artifacts to Eclipse Target Platform (from PDE[1]) using the M2E[2] settings.

You can also choose to include dependencies as well, beside this it wraps non-osgi jars using BND Lib[3] in a way so it can be used without special handling as a bundle.

Note: Includes icons from M2E[2]
